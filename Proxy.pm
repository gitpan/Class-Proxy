=head1 NAME

Class::Proxy - an object proxy

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Class::Proxy;

	my $pobj = Class::Proxy->new( victim => $obj );

	$pobj->victim_method();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Objects can be served by C<Class::Proxy>. In practice, any method call to the proxy will
be forwarded to the original object (victim). The purpose of that is to alter method
calls in a generic way. This can be used for

and many more.

=head2 Altering calls

Class::Proxy is a C<Class::Listener> (L<Class::Listener>). Two signals are registered to it:

=over 4

=item method

When a method is called.

=item victim

When a victim was assigned.

=back

=head1 HIDING

The C<Class::Proxy> constructor returns a C<Class::Proxy> object and not a victim object. That means it isn't
very good hiding itsef and this may cause conflicts. But when the victim class was written following oo-recommendations
C<Class::Proxy> should work fine.

[Note] In future C<Class::Proxy> will try to obscure himself (via tie?). Currently ref() or isa() call would
reveal C<Class::Proxy>. Also caller() would give hints.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
