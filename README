Class/Proxy
===========

Objects can be served by "Class::Proxy". In practice, any method call to
the proxy will be forwarded to the original object (victim). The purpose
of that is to alter method calls in a generic way. This can be used for

*   faking

*   restriction

*   logging

*   benchmarking

*   forwarding

*   versioning

*   caching

and many more.
